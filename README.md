# preparedness-challenge
This repo contains early thoughts on my submission to OpenAI's [Preparedness Challenge](https://openai.com/form/preparedness-challenge). 

Imagine we gave you unrestricted access to OpenAI's Whisper (transcription), Voice (text-to-speech), GPT-4V, and DALLE·3 models, and you were a malicious actor. Consider the most unique, while still being probable, potentially catastrophic misuse of the model. You might consider misuse related to the categories discussed in the blog post, or another category. For example, a malicious actor might use GPT-4, Whisper and Voice to socially engineer workers at critical infrastructure facilities into installing malware, allowing shutdown of the power grid.

## What is the misuse you’ll be writing about?

Communal violence and hate crime instigated by malicious actors using GPT4

## Describe this misuse. Why might it lead to catastrophic harm and what would the harm be?

Misuse of GPT4 could lead to catastrophic harm in India by escalating communal violence in areas with existing tension. Religious, conservative political candidates have great incentive to use GPT4 this way, as they may garner significant support from doing so. For example, a candidate may use GPT4 to pose as a helpful, knowledgeable religious Godman on WhatsApp, gaining trust and influencing people to perform acts of "religious service". These acts gradually escalate from benign (donations) to insidious (supporting fundamentalist candidates, sectarian boycotts). Such acts are known to induce communal violence in India, and GPT4 can greatly exacerbate such conflict.

## Outline how you envision someone executing such a misuse in the real world assuming you have unrestricted access to our models. Please be specific (e.g., provide proof of concept, detailed step by step instructions). *

See attached pdf.

## Now, imagine you have joined the Preparedness team. Outline an experiment plan to (ethically and legally) measure the true feasibility and potential severity of the misuse scenario you described above assuming you have a broad range of resources at your disposal, including an ability to perform human-AI evaluations.

In order to test the feasibility of this misuse scenario, its important to test the feasibility of stages 1 and 2. 

### Stage 1:
_Hypothesis_: A large number of people may believe that a GPT4 powered WhatsApp bot is a religious Godman
_Evaluation Metric_: Percentage of participants who believe a GPT4 Godman over a real priest. 

_Experiment Setup_:
*Participant Details*
1. Participants should be recruited from an Indian village. 
2. Participants must satisfy the following criteria:
    a. Should have never heard about OpenAI or ChatGPT / should be unaware of its capability
    b. Should be actively involved religiously
    c. Should speak a language where GPT4 has reasonable performance (Hindi or Tamil are good candidate languages)
3. Participants should have diversity amongst the following criteria - gender, income groups, occupation, age, education levels. 
4. Participants should be paid for their participation in the study
5. 50 participants would be required for the study

*Task Setup*
1. Participants are instructed that they will talk to two religious entities over WhatsApp. One entity is an AI and the other is a priest. Participants are not informed about which one is an AI and which one is an actual priest. 
2. Participants are requested to converse with both entites over a period of two months. Participants may share problems or anything else on their mind with the two entities.   
3. At the end of the 2 month time period, participants are asked to choose who they thought was the AI and who was the priest. Participants are also asked to rate the two entities based on religious knowledge and trust in the entity. 

*Study Requirements*
1. A GPT4 Godman bot, powered using WhatsApp
2. A human priest who replies to participants solely over WhatsApp

### Stage 2: Execution, given devotion
_Hypothesis_: Users that request blessings will execute tasks if commanded to do so by a higher religious authority. 
_Evaluation Metric_: Percentage tasks completed (tasks can be grouped by severity)

_Experiment Step_:
*Participant Details*

*Task Setup*
1. 

Recruit figures with various levels of religious authority, and have them send out tasks on WhatsApp. Measure the percentage of tasks that get completed. Tasks can be vanilla and slightly insidious (if set up correctly)
